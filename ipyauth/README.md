## 1 - Overview

This is a [Jupyter widget](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) enabling the notebook user to negotiate (via OAuth2 implicit flow) a token from an ID provider - currently Auth0, Google.  

The token obtained is passed on to the Python kernel, then the user can make requests to protected APIs.
